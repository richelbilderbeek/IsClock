# IsClock

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/IsClock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/IsClock)

The IsClock is [one of my machines](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/Machines) that uses Arduino.
It's a clock that displays the time as the solution of its equation.

For example `1:02` is displayed as `0.5` as one divided by two equals one half.
